# CashIn-Algorithm
MICRO APPLICATION 3 - A cash machine simulator

I wondered which kind of algorithm the cash machine uses to always provide me the least amount of bank notes as possible (when I want $180, for example,
it gives me a $100,$20 x 4, for example) according to the ones the machine has available - where I live, the cash machines use to have only $20, $50
and $100 bank notes available, never seen them having lower than that (wonder how small shops got them). Wonder how myself always knew the bank notes I
would receive and thought on doing it with code.
